\description{
Real-time data from moored ocean buoys for improved detection, understanding
and prediction of El Ni'o and La Ni'a. The data is collected by the
Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project
(\url{http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/index.shtml}).
}
\details{
Format: a data frame with 736 observations on the following 8
variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{year}}{A factor with levels \code{1993} \code{1997}.}
\item{\code{latitude}}{A factor with levels \code{-5}  \code{-2} \code{0}.}
\item{\code{longitude}}{A factor with levels \code{-110} \code{-95}.}
\item{\code{sea_temp_c}}{Sea surface temperature(degree Celsius),  measured
by the TAO buoys at one meter below the surface.}
\item{\code{air_temp_c}}{Air temperature(degree Celsius), measured by the
TAO buoys three meters above the sea surface.}
\item{\code{humidity}}{Relative humidity(%), measured by the TAO buoys 3
meters above the sea surface.}
\item{\code{wind_ew}}{The East-West wind vector components(M/s).  TAO buoys
measure the wind speed and direction four meters above the sea surface.
If it is positive, the East-West component of the wind is blowing towards
the East. If it is negative, this component is blowing towards the West.}
\item{\code{wind_ns}}{The North-South wind vector components(M/s). TAO
buoys measure the wind speed and direction four meters above the sea
surface. If it is positive, the North-South component of the wind is
blowing towards the North. If it is negative, this component is blowing
towards the South.}}
